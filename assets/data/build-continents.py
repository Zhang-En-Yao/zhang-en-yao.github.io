"""Regenerate continents.json — which continent each country in the atlas belongs to.

The atlas (countries-50m.json) carries a country's name and nothing else, but the travel
map needs to group countries by continent to zoom to one. This joins the two by name
against Natural Earth, which is where the atlas itself comes from, so the names line up.

Run from the repo root when the atlas changes:
