"""Regenerate countries-10m.json and marine-areas.json from Natural Earth 1:10m.

Three layers, straight from the Natural Earth vector repository, with nothing changed but
the property list (trimmed to the fields the map reads) and the encoding:

  ne_10m_admin_0_countries                        → countries-10m.json, object "countries"
  ne_10m_geography_marine_polys                   → marine-areas.json, object "areas"
  ne_10m_admin_0_boundary_lines_maritime_indicator → marine-areas.json, object "borders"

GeoJSON at this resolution is 15 MB; TopoJSON stores each shared border once and
delta-encodes it, which is what makes 1:10m affordable on a static site. Simplification
drops the smallest triangles until half the vertices are gone — at the map's deepest zoom
one pixel is about a kilometre, so what goes was never visible. countries-50m.json stays
in the repo: the map paints that first and only fetches this when someone zooms in.

Needs node for the TopoJSON tools, which are fetched by npx on first run:

    python3 assets/data/build-atlas.py
    python3 assets/data/build-atlas.py --keep 0.7   # keep more vertices
